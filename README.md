 # About Login and Registration System


The Login and Registration System in C++ allows users to securely register and log in with unique credentials. During registration, users provide a username and password, which are then stored in a file database for future access. Once registered, users can log in by verifying their credentials against the stored data. If the login details match, the system grants access; otherwise, it prompts the user to re-enter the correct credentials.

Key Features:

User Registration: New users can register by providing a username and password, which are securely saved in a file.

Login Authentication: Registered users can log in using their credentials. The system verifies the input by checking the saved file.

Data Persistence: All user credentials are stored in files, ensuring that the data remains available for future login attempts.

This system is designed for any application requiring user authentication and aims to provide a basic yet secure way to manage user accounts. It's ideal for small-scale systems where simple credential management is needed.
